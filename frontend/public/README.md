# Public Directory

## Purpose
The public directory contains static assets that are served directly without being processed by webpack. These files are accessible by the browser and are used for resources that don't need to be bundled.

## Files and Their Roles
- **favicon.ico**: The icon displayed in the browser tab for the website.
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the React application.
- **logo192.png** and **logo512.png**: Logo images used for various purposes, including PWA icons.
- **manifest.json**: Configuration file for Progressive Web App (PWA) settings.
- **robots.txt**: Instructions for search engine crawlers.
- **images/**: Directory containing image assets used throughout the application.

## Important Details
- The `index.html` file contains the root DOM element where the React application is mounted.
- Any files in this directory are copied as-is to the build folder during the build process.
- To reference files in this directory from your code, use the `%PUBLIC_URL%` prefix in HTML or `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` in JavaScript.
