# Projects Widgets Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains individual UI components (widgets) that are used specifically for the Projects page. These widgets are modular, reusable components that make up different parts of the Projects page interface.

## Files and Their Roles
- **project_card.jsx**: A React component that renders an individual project card. This component is responsible for displaying a preview of a project, including its image, title, brief description, and potentially other metadata like technologies used or completion date.

## Important Details
- The project_card component is likely used in a list or grid layout on the Projects page to display multiple projects.
- The component probably receives project data as props from the parent Projects page component.
- When a user clicks on a project card, it likely navigates to the detailed view of that project in the project_detail section.
- The modular approach allows for easier maintenance and updates to the project card display without affecting the overall Projects page layout.
- The styling for this component is kept in a separate CSS file in the styles directory, maintaining a clean separation of concerns.
