# Home Widgets Styles Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains CSS files that define the styling for each of the widget components used on the home page. Separating styles into their own directory helps maintain a clean separation of concerns between component logic and presentation.

## Files and Their Roles
- **app_bar.css**: Styles for the application's navigation bar/header component.
- **colloboraters.css**: Styles for the collaborators/partners showcase component.
- **footer.css**: Styles for the page footer component.
- **projects_section.css**: Styles for the projects showcase component.
- **service_section.css**: Styles for the services display component.
- **user_feedback.css**: Styles for the testimonials/user feedback component.

## Important Details
- Each CSS file corresponds directly to a specific widget component in the parent directory.
- The stylesheets likely include responsive design rules to ensure the widgets look good on various screen sizes.
- When making visual changes to a specific widget, the corresponding CSS file in this directory should be modified.
- The separation of styles into individual files makes it easier to maintain and update the appearance of specific components without affecting others.
