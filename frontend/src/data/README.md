# Data Directory

## Purpose
The data directory contains data models, structures, and utilities that define the shape of data used throughout the application. It serves as a bridge between the frontend and backend by providing consistent data structures.

## Files and Their Roles
- **ProjectModel.java**: A Java model class that defines the structure of project data. This file is likely used as a reference for ensuring consistency between frontend and backend data structures.

## Important Details
- The presence of a Java file in the frontend suggests a shared data model approach between the frontend (React) and backend (Spring Boot) parts of the application.
- When working with project data in the frontend, refer to this model to ensure data consistency with the backend.
- This directory may be expanded in the future to include more data models or data handling utilities as the application grows.
