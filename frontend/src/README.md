# Source Directory

## Purpose
The source directory contains all the React application code, including components, styles, utilities, and application logic. This is where most of the development work happens.

## Files and Their Roles
- **App.js**: The main React component that serves as the root of the component tree.
- **App.css**: Styles specific to the App component.
- **App.test.js**: Test file for the App component.
- **index.js**: The entry point for the React application that renders the App component to the DOM.
- **index.css**: Global styles applied to the entire application.
- **logo.svg**: SVG logo used in the application.
- **reportWebVitals.js**: Utility for measuring performance metrics.
- **setupTests.js**: Configuration file for setting up testing environment.

## Subdirectories
- **data/**: Contains data models and structures used throughout the application.
- **presentation/**: Contains UI components organized by application sections/pages.

## Important Details
- The application follows a structured organization with clear separation between data and presentation layers.
- The presentation directory is further organized by application sections, each with its own components and styles.
- The application uses React for building the user interface and managing component state.
