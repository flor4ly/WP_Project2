# Home Directory

This directory contains components related to the Home page of the application.

## Contents

- `home_page.jsx`: The main component for the Home page
- `home.css`: Stylesheet for the Home page component
- `provider/`: Directory containing provider components for the Home page
- `widgets/`: Directory containing widget components used on the Home page

## Purpose

The Home directory houses components that:
- Display the main landing page of the application
- Present key information and features to users
- Provide navigation to other sections of the application
- Showcase important content and highlights

## Structure

The Home directory has a more complex structure than other presentation directories:
- The main component and its styles are at the root level
- The `provider` directory contains context providers specific to the Home page
- The `widgets` directory contains smaller, reusable components used on the Home page

## Usage

The Home components are typically the first components rendered when users visit the application. They serve as the entry point and provide an overview of what the application offers.
