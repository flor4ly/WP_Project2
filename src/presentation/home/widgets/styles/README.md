# Styles Directory

This directory contains CSS styles specific to the widget components used on the Home page.

## Contents

- `app_bar.css`: Styles for the navigation bar component
- `colloboraters.css`: Styles for the collaborators/partners component
- `footer.css`: Styles for the footer component
- `service_section.css`: Styles for the services showcase component
- `user_feedback.css`: Styles for the user testimonials/feedback component

## Purpose

The styles directory contains CSS files that:
- Define the visual appearance of each widget component
- Ensure consistent styling across the Home page widgets
- Separate styling concerns from component logic
- Provide component-specific styling that is not covered by global styles

## Usage

These style files are imported by their corresponding widget components to apply specific styling. This separation of concerns helps maintain a clean and modular codebase, making it easier to update the appearance of individual components without affecting others.
