# Widgets Directory

This directory contains smaller, reusable UI components (widgets) used on the Home page of the application.

## Contents

- `appbar.jsx`: Navigation bar component
- `colloboraters.jsx`: Component displaying collaborators or partners
- `footer.jsx`: Footer component for the page
- `service_section.jsx`: Component showcasing services offered
- `user_feedback.jsx`: Component for displaying user testimonials or feedback
- `styles/`: Directory containing styles specific to the widget components

## Purpose

The widgets directory contains components that:
- Provide specific functionality or display specific content on the Home page
- Are smaller and more focused than the main page components
- May be reused across different sections of the Home page
- Break down the UI into manageable, maintainable pieces

## Usage

These widget components are imported and used by the main Home page component to build the complete UI. This modular approach makes the codebase more maintainable and allows for easier updates to specific parts of the page.
