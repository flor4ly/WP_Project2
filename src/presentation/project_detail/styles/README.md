# Styles Directory

This directory contains CSS styles specific to the Project Detail components.

## Contents

- `project_detail.css`: Stylesheet for the Project Detail component

## Purpose

The styles directory contains CSS files that:
- Define the visual appearance of Project Detail components
- Ensure consistent styling across the project detail section
- Separate styling concerns from component logic
- Provide component-specific styling that is not covered by global styles

## Usage

These styles are imported by the Project Detail components to apply specific styling that is not covered by global styles. This separation helps maintain a clean and modular codebase.
