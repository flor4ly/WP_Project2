# Styles Directory

This directory contains CSS styles specific to the About page components.

## Contents

- `about.css`: Stylesheet for the About page component

## Purpose

The styles directory contains CSS files that:
- Define the visual appearance of About page components
- Ensure consistent styling across the About section
- Separate styling concerns from component logic

## Usage

These styles are imported by the About page components to apply specific styling that is not covered by global styles. This separation helps maintain a clean and modular codebase.
