# Projects Directory

This directory contains components related to the Projects page of the application.

## Contents

- `projects_page.jsx`: The main component for the Projects page
- `styles/`: Directory containing styles specific to the Projects components
- `widgets/`: Directory containing smaller, reusable components used on the Projects page

## Purpose

The Projects directory houses components that:
- Display a list or grid of projects
- Provide filtering and sorting functionality for projects
- Present project previews or summaries
- Allow navigation to detailed project views

## Structure

The Projects directory has a structure similar to the Home directory:
- The main component is at the root level
- The `styles` directory contains CSS files for styling the Projects components
- The `widgets` directory contains smaller, reusable components specific to the Projects page

## Usage

The Projects components are typically rendered when users navigate to the Projects section of the application. They provide an overview of available projects and allow users to browse and select specific projects to view in detail.
