# Styles Directory

This directory contains CSS styles specific to the Projects page components.

## Contents

- `projects.css`: Stylesheet for the main Projects page component
- `project_card.css`: Stylesheet for the Project Card component used to display individual project previews

## Purpose

The styles directory contains CSS files that:
- Define the visual appearance of Projects page components
- Ensure consistent styling across the projects section
- Separate styling concerns from component logic
- Provide component-specific styling that is not covered by global styles

## Usage

These style files are imported by their corresponding components to apply specific styling. This separation of concerns helps maintain a clean and modular codebase, making it easier to update the appearance of individual components without affecting others.
