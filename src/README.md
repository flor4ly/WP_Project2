# Source Directory (src)

This directory contains all the React source code for the application.

## Contents

- `App.js`: The main React component that serves as the application's entry point
- `App.css`: Styles specific to the App component
- `App.test.js`: Tests for the App component
- `index.js`: The JavaScript entry point that renders the React application
- `index.css`: Global CSS styles for the application
- `logo.svg`: SVG logo used in the application
- `reportWebVitals.js`: Performance measurement utility
- `setupTests.js`: Configuration for testing
- `data/`: Directory containing data models and services
- `presentation/`: Directory containing UI components organized by feature

## Structure

The source code follows a feature-based organization:

- Core application files are at the root level
- The `data` directory contains data models and services
- The `presentation` directory contains UI components organized by feature or page

## Best Practices

- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Maintain separation between data and presentation layers
- Use consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase
