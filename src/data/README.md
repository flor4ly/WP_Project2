# Data Directory

This directory contains data models, services, and utilities for managing application data.

## Contents

- `ProjectModel.java`: Java model class for project data (Note: This appears to be a Java file in a JavaScript project, which is unusual)

## Purpose

The data directory is responsible for:
- Defining data structures and models
- Providing services for data fetching and manipulation
- Handling data validation and transformation
- Separating data concerns from presentation logic

## Usage

Data models and services from this directory should be imported by components that need to interact with application data. This separation helps maintain a clean architecture and makes the codebase more maintainable.
